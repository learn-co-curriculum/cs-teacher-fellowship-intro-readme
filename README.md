# Welcome!

Welcome to part 1 of the Flatiron Computer Science Fellowship! We’re so excited that you’re here and have decided to learn to code (or improve on your existing knowledge) with us. As you start your learning with us, it’s important for you to know that you’re on the frontier of computer science education in the U.S. - nothing of this scale and depth has been done before. It’s an exciting time to be a teacher learning to code.

Please know that this curriculum for teachers is in “Beta” - this means that we’re continuing to work and build on it, and are relying on you and your feedback to make it better for future cohorts of teachers. If you have suggestions, edits, or see potential issues with the curriculum, please use the “Submit an Issue” button on the lesson in question.

Part of what makes Learn a great platform for learning is the community. Soon there will be hundreds of teachers working on this track and helping each other through the material. If you’re stuck on a lab or are struggling to understand a concept, start by using the “Ask a Question” Feature to get help from your peers and the teaching staff at Flatiron. While it may seem intimidating to post a question, I PROMISE that other people are also grappling with the same material - you’re not only helping yourself by asking a question, you’re helping the whole community.

On the flip side, we hope you will help your fellow teachers when you are comfortable with topics and labs. One of our tenets at Flatiron is “Teaching is Learning” - that is, the more you practice teaching a subject, the better you will know and understand it yourself. So answer questions as often as you can!

As you work through the material, you'll notice that several of the labs are labeled **"Pre-College Lab"**. That's because we want you to work through the same material that your students will encounter should you choose to teach with Flatiron's curriculum. The pre-college labs are built for high school students, and will give you a clear sense of what our students should be able to complete at different points in the course. The content and exposition in your track will go into much further depth than the student curriculum, but it's important for you to have the 'pre-college experience' before you teach it.

This first track should take 70 to 100 hours to complete, at which point we’ll be in touch to help you decide whether to pursue our Advanced Front End or Back End tracks. Check out this [suggested work schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lMSAKlTYRNTXrsd_Oa_wnyDKG2uzhfvRreXBEXBjXFg/edit#gid=0) to get a sense of an ideal pace for the program. We hope you enjoy the challenge ahead of you - please reach out if you have any questions or concerns at all.

Best,

The Flatiron Team
